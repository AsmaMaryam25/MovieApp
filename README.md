## Features  

### 1. Movie Search

- The results display relevant metadata, including movie thumbnails.  

### 2. Watch List  
- Users can add or remove movies from their personal watchlist.  
- The watchlist is presented as a scrollable list, and selecting a movie redirects to its detailed page.  

### 3. Categorized Home Page  
- Movies are displayed in carousels under categories such as:  
  - **Now Playing**  
  - **Popular**  
  - **Top Rated**  
  - **Upcoming**  

### 4. Movie Metadata  
- The movie details page provides information on:  
  - Cast and crew  
  - Ratings  
  - A button to view trailers on YouTube (if available).  

### 5. User-Friendly Navigation  
- A bottom navigation bar ensures easy access to key sections like Home, Search, Favorites, and Watchlist.  
- The design follows minimalist principles, making it visually calming in both Light and Dark modes.

## Design Highlights  

- **Consistency**: The thumbnail layout is uniform across search and favorites pages.

- **Aesthetic Choices**: The app uses a clean color palette, including blue tones, to maintain a professional yet engaging look.
